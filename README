							Machine Learning Project.

The three folders contain three different datasets to run the model on.

To run on a dataset, go to the desired folder and just run script.m(in each folder) file in matlab.

The code will generate the desired result.

I only used the Gaussian Kernel in our implementation, use can also add more kernels.
